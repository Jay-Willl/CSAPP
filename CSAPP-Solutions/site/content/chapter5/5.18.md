try to write 6*3a version for function holy.

this solution is not fully tested on my machine, sorry for that :(

    uname -p

> Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3210M CPU @ 2.50GHz

if your machine core is Intel Core i7 Haswell like book, you can try
install google [gperftools](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) for profile

    (cd ./site/content/chapter5/code; make 5.18.prof)

loop more times is a good idea :)
