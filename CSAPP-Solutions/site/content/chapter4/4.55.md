Problem mismatch with skeleton code, we follow the code here:
**change J_YES to UNCOND**

one point is

    M_icode == IJXX && M_ifun != UNCOND

means all jxx except jmp instruction

another important point is Mispredicted branch condition

origin

    (E_icode == IJXX && !e_Cnd)

now

    (E_icode == IJXX && E_ifun != UNCOND && e_Cnd)

if e_Cnd means misprediction

check file `./site/content/chapter4/code/sim/pipe/pipe-nt.hcl`

watch changes with origin pipe-nt.hcl

    (cd ./site/content/chapter4/code/sim/pipe; diff -u origin-pipe-nt.hcl pipe-nt.hcl)

{{< include file="./chapter4/code/sim/pipe/pipe-nt.diff" language="diff" >}}
