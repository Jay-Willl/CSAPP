A.

consider load/use hazard

    E_icode in { IMRMOVQ, IPOPQ } && E_dstM in { d_srcA, d_srcB };

|situation|1|2|3|4|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|E_dstM == d_srcA|1|1|0|0|
|E_dstM == d_srcB|1|0|1|0|

situation 4:

normal, no hazard happens

situation 1,2,3:

load/use hazard happens

if E_icode in { IMRMOVQ, IPOPQ }, then E_dstM must not be RNONE

consider situation 1 and 3, E_dstM == d_srcB, then d_srcB is not RNONE and must
be used in phase E, so load-forward can't work. load-forward only work in situation 2!

consider all the instructions that d_srcA is not RNONE

|instructions|d_srcA|valA used in phase E?|load-forward works?|
|-|-|-|-|
|rrmovq|rA|Y|N|
|rmmovq|rA|N|Y|
|opq|rA|Y|N|
|pushq|rA|N|Y|
|ret|rsp|N|N|
|popq|rsp|N|N|

ret and popq can't work because d_srcA == d_srcB == %rsp, that's not in
situation 2!!

finally, load/use only work in condition:

    E_icode in { IMRMOVQ, IPOPQ } &&
    (
      E_dstM == d_srcB ||
      (
        E_dstM == d_srcA && !(D_icode in { IRMMOVQ, IPUSHQ })
      )
    );
